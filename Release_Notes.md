# Release Notes for <mark>W25Q128J Part Drivers</mark> SW Pack

STM32Cube enables developers to achieve design success. With a comprehensive suite of professional development tools and embedded software components, STM32Cube allows developers to differentiate products, streamline design cycles, and reduce costs. STM32Cube ecosystem supports all design steps, including selection, configuration, development, debugging, programming, and monitoring.
The STM32Cube embedded software offer provides ready-to-use software components that can be added to a project. It includes STM32 peripheral driver APIs with two levels of abstraction, middleware, board drivers, and examples. There are several distribution channels, including the STM32CubeMX2 tool, the ST website, and GitHub. All embedded software comes with enhanced online documentation, with flowcharts and user sequences.
